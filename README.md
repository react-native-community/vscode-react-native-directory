## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

* Search through the packages registered in the React Native Directory.
* Narrow down the results by using filter tokens, such as `:ios`, `:newArchitecture`, or `:hasTypes`.
  * Valid tokens are a subset of all possible API query options, and the values can be seen [in this file](/src/utils.ts#L30-L51).
* Install the selected packages in the current workspace using your preferred package manager.
* Dive deep into the stats and analysis with the provided metadata and links.
